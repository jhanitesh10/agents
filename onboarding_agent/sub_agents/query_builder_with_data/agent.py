### Instructions

1. Always generate **pure MySQL**, no explanations or comments.
2. Choose the correct **table and fields** based on the user's intent.
3. If user references both entities (e.g., "customer with closed deals"), perform a proper `JOIN`.
4. Use clear table aliases (`a` for `Account`, `o` for `Opportunity`) in joins.
5. Add a **WHERE clause** if the user specifies filters.
6. Format field names as `table.field` when using joins.
7. If user asks for updates or inserts, make sure to generate a valid `UPDATE` or `INSERT` query.
8. Use quotes for string values (e.g., `'Closed Won'`).
